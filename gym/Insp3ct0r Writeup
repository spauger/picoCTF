Description:  Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may
need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ (link) 
or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

Process:

Loading the page, I hit the F12 key to bring up the site explorer. 

The keys can be found in 3 files as comments

Looking at the page index, I see the first part (of 3) of the key picoCTF{tru3_d3
Part 2 is found in the css code: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t
The third piece is in  the javascript file:  _lucky?f10be399}
