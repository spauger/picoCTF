# picoCTF
some of my picoCTF write-ups 

In order to teach myself a few more skills, I've decided to try some CTF exercises. Specifically, I'm going to be using picoCTF. Going to go through their introduction and some tutorial materials as well as going through their gym to be able to apply those skills.

This repository is here for me to track solutions and resources I've used in
